		<p>Below, you can find a set of useful things to note when you intend to play in a season of SurvivORG. Not all of them will apply to everyone, but some of them will surely apply to you.</p>

		<h1 id="interview">The General Interview Notes&trade;</h1>
		<p>These are some things you should consider before you take your casting interview.</p>
		<h2>1. Consistency</h2>
		<p>“Okay, biiiig paragraph for the first question, biiiig paragraph for the second question, two big paragraphs for the third, and... One sentence answers for the rest of the interview. Wait, fuck.”</p>
		<h2>2. Interest</h2>
		<p>Telling us you do lots of ORGs at the same time makes us feel disposable, and we don't want to feel disposable. Going away during your interview for large stretches of time without telling us, as a few people have done in the past, is not going to get you on the season.</p>
		<h2>3. Verifiability</h2>
		<p>Give us references to past play if you've played in the past. Proof that you're an interesting player makes getting on the show easier. Who would've known.</p>
		<h2>4. Break the Mold</h2>
		<p>Don't be afraid to break the mold. A lot of people do very similar, somewhat gamebotty answers. Anything new, different and unique is instantly noticeable and makes the interview more memorable.</p>
		<h2>5. BE <em>FUCKING</em> BETTER</h2>
		<p>The fuck does relevance even mean? Your concept of relevance isn't relevant. BE. <em>FUCKING.</em> BETTER. You're not getting cast off the back of being known by people.</p>
